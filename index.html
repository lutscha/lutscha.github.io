                    About Me
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I am a sophomore at MIT. I am majoring in Mathematics (Course 18), minoring in Finance (15-3) and eyeing a potential double major with either
                    Economics, Computer Science and Data Science (6-14) or Computation and Cognition (6-9).<br>

                    To put it simply - I enjoy problem-solving. I especially enjoy talking about eye-opening solutions to problems and sharing insights into creative thinking that
                    I encounter on my problem-solving "travels". This might be part of the <a href="pripreme.html">reason</a> you've found this site. <br>
                    Beyond that I am a member of the Men's Heavyweight Crew Team at MIT, volunteer at MIT ESP's Splash & do recreational archery(when problem sets don't overrun me).
                    Some the projects on this site will be focused around hobbies, mostly regarding nature, hiking and exploring, something I do a lot of <a href="mnemap.html">back in Montenegro</a>".<br>
